Beneath is a strategy I follow when attempting to learning a new programming language.

1. Read around the theory behind the language. Try to find out the following; What differentiates this language from all the others? What were the main drivers for developing the language?

2. Try to find some Koans / Katas you can run through. I find applying my new found knowledge to small problems helps it sink in.
